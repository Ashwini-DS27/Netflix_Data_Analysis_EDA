# Netflix Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Netflix Titles dataset to understand content distribution, trends, and patterns using Python and Pandas.

## Dataset
- Source: Netflix Titles Dataset
- Rows: ~8,800
- Columns: 12

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Analysis Performed
- Dataset structure and summary
- Handling missing values
- Removing unnecessary columns
- Content type distribution (Movies vs TV Shows)
- Country-wise content distribution
- Rating distribution analysis

## Key Insights
- Movies dominate Netflix content over TV Shows
- The United States is the top content producer, followed by India
- Most content is targeted toward mature audiences (TV-MA, TV-14)
- Data cleaning was essential to handle missing and incorrect values

## Files in this Repository
- `Network_Data_Analysis_EDA.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with full EDA
- `netflix_titles.csv` – Dataset used for analysis

## Conclusion
This EDA provides a strong foundation for further analysis or machine learning tasks related to content recommendation or trend analysis.
